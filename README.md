# Steven-Le-Portfolio
[Personal portfolio website](https://www.stevenlexr.com/) which showcases my technical skills, experiences, and projects. This is my first React and ThreeJS website. I deployed it on Vercel with my custom domain: www.stevenlexr.com.


## Inspiration Behind Design
I wanted to use ThreeJS to emphasize my interest in immersion and user experience. ThreeJS enabled me to create a website that would be interactive, garnering attention and a positive user experience.

## Technology Used
- ThreeJS
- React
- HTML
- Tailwind CSS
- Javascript
- Vercel
- Shaders
- GitHub
- Git
- Node JS


## Credit and Contribution
As this is my first React and ThreeJS website, I followed this wonderful [tutorial](https://youtu.be/0fYi8SGA20k?si=orUYVF30ArdIwhyU) to learn how to make a website with these new frameworks; however, I heavily modified it to match my preferences once I understood more about web development. Major modifications I made:
- Overhauled entire Hero section with interactive text that changes based on mouse input ([Inspiration](https://webflow.com/made-in-webflow/website/Text-Particles-with-ThreeJS)).
  - Optimized for less lag by only showing the particles when it is on screen, disabling them when user scrolls past.
  - Learned shaders.
  - Learned how to translate HTML and Javascript to JSX.
- Dynamically updated background gradient to smoothly change colors while scrolling through the page to better match colors in the foreground.
- Disabled scrolling animations on Mobile devices to prevent overloading the browser, which prevented certain sections from displaying.
- Added [Robot](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/robot-playground-59fc99d8dcb146f3a6c16dbbcc4680da) 3D Model next to contact form
- Deployment to Vercel (with CI/CD) and obtained a custom domain
